## CSS SANDBOX

### INFORMATION
I am a true beginner in the realm of coding.  

This is my first mini project that doesn't follow Free Code Camp's Learning
Path.  

**CSS SANDBOX** lets you create a snippit of code.  Basically, you make a div
with a paragraph inside it.  You can customize the style with input sliders.  I
have included a ton of options for customization.  Many of which, a beginner,
might not be aware of.  The cool part about **CSS SANDBOX** is that it gives
you the code whenever you want.  Now you can copy and paste the code from your
**CSS SANDBOX** project into your own project!  You create something.
### CSS VARIABLES
CSS Variables are the key to this project.  They allow us so much power.  I 
strongly recommend that if you find yourself here and interested in my project
that you look into WesBos 30 in 30.  There is a link inside the help menu.  He
explains the variables and how to use them in one of his tutorials.  This is 
where I got the idea for this in the first place.

### STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
As I learn more and more, I plan on improving **CSS SANDBOX**.  Right now you
are stuck with just a div.  I think I would like to let the user create elements,
but that is for a later time.  I have so many ideas.
