##CSS SANDBOX

###INFORMATION
I am a true beginner in the realm of coding.  

This is my first mini project that doesn't follow Free Code Camp's Learning
Path.  

**CSS SANDBOX** lets you create a snippit of code.  Basically, you make a div
with a paragraph inside it.  You can customize the style with input sliders.  I
have included a ton of options for customization.  Many of which, a beginner,
might not be aware of.  The cool part about **CSS SANDBOX** is that it gives
you the code whenever you want.  Now you can copy and paste the code from your
**CSS SANDBOX** project into your own project!  You create somehthing.
